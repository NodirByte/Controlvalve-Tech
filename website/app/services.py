RAYS is the real API 6D valve manufacturer for the Trunnion mounted ball valve. These valves feature a round or spherical disk in the center that rotates to start or stop the flow. This disk is called a ball and it features a hollow center. Ball valves are extremely versatile and are commonly used in industrial applications where tight shut-off is required.
          Side Entry Trunnion mounted ball valves feature additional support for the ball. This support is in the shape of a shaft and is called a trunnion. The trunnion absorbs any added pressure from the flow, reducing stress on the ball and seats of the valve. Trunnion mounted ball valves are used in high-pressure, large scale applications where low operating torque is required.''',

The inverse taper for the diameter of the fitting section with the valve cover is set in the annular gap formed between the conical surface of the reverse taper on the stuffing box, the inner hole of the valve body and the end surface of the valve cover facing the inside of the valve. This corresponds to the shape of the gap sealing ring. Using the above technical scheme, the pressure of the liquid medium itself is used to achieve the purpose of sealing.
